# Student-Marksheet-Management-System
The Student Marksheet Management System is a C++ console-based application that efficiently manages student records using file handling. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete student marksheets while ensuring data persistence through text file storage. When adding a new student, the system checks for duplicate registration numbers before saving the details, including subject-wise marks. Users can retrieve an individual studentâ€™s marksheet, displaying total marks, percentage, and grade based on predefined criteria. The system also supports updating and deleting records, where old data is replaced or removed from the file. Additionally, it provides a detailed class-wise marksheet, showing all students' results in a structured format. The program calculates grades based on percentage and categorizes students accordingly. It uses object-oriented principles with modular functions to keep the code structured and readable. With its menu-driven interface and file handling capabilities, this system is useful for educational institutions or learning file operations in C++.
